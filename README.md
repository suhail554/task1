OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT:create a C++ program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.provide feeddback on whether the guess is too high or low until the user guesses the number.
Here are the key objectives for a "Guess the Random Number" program in C++:

1. **Generate a Random Number**: Create a random number within a specified range for the user to guess.

2. **User Input**: Allow the user to input their guess.

3. **Compare Guess**: Check if the userâ€™s guess matches the randomly generated number.

4. **Provide Feedback**: Inform the user if their guess is too high, too low, or correct.

5. **Count Attempts**: Track the number of attempts the user makes to guess the correct number.

6. **Repeat or End**: Allow the user to play again or exit the game after guessing correctly or choosing to quit.

7. **Handle Invalid Input**: Ensure the program can handle non-numeric inputs and prompt the user to enter a valid guess.

8. **Display Results**: Show the number of attempts and whether the user won or lost.
